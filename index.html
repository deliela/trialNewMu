         <h3><em><strong>-About Mohammed Ali:</strong></em></h3>
         <h6>
         He was born in January 17, 1942 with the given name Cassius Clay Jr.He then changed his name to Muhammed Ali after he embraced the Islamic religion<br>
         <em>- "That's my original name; that's a black man name,</em>"Ali said. <em>"Cassius Clay was my slave name. I'm no longer a slave."</em><br>
         he was an American professional boxer and activist. He is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century.Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. he was involved in several historic boxing matches.Among these were the first Liston fight; the "Fight of the Century", "Super Fight II", the "Thrilla in Manila" versus his rival Joe Frazier, and "The Rumble in the Jungle" versus George Foreman.In March 1966, Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970—from ages 25 to almost 29—as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971. Muhammad Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons.<br>
         Muhammad Ali, the man considered the greatest boxer of all time, died in June 3, 2016 at a hospital in Phoenix at age 74.<br>
